<div class="container">

<p class= "story"> The number of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients in New York City has remained high following a spike in enrollment at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p class= "story"> “I would hypothesize it has something to do with a lot of the administrative barriers being lifted,” wrote Karen Florez, an associate professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health, in an email. “The pandemic also might have reduced the stigma attached to the program.” </p>
<p class= "story"> While applying for SNAP <a href="https://epicenter-nyc.com/the-economy-is-doing-better-so-why-are-food-pantry-lines-longer/">has been difficult lately</a>, food insecurity during the height of the pandemic pushed many New Yorkers to seek SNAP benefits, among other social services. </p>
<p class= "story"> This citywide trend especially affected neighborhoods that already had a high number of SNAP recipients, like Washington Heights and Inwood. Enrollment in the area jumped by 87.5% between March 2020 and September of the same year, recently peaking at 49,855 in March 2023. </p>
